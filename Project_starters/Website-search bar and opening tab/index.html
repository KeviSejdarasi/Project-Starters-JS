        <p>The fifth generation of the BMW 5 Series executive cars consists of the BMW E60 (saloon version) and BMW E61 (wagon version, marketed as 'Touring'). The E60/E61 generation was produced by BMW from 2003 to 2010 and is often collectively referred to as the E60. The E60 generation introduced various new electronic features, including the iDrive infotainment system, head-up display, active cruise control, active steering, adaptive headlights, night vision, lane departure warning and voice control. The E60 was the first 5 Series to be available with a turbocharged petrol engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission and regenerative braking. The M5 model was introduced in 2005 and is powered by the BMW S85 V10 engine. It was sold in the saloon and wagon body styles, with most cars using the 7-speed SMG III transmission. It was the first and only M5 model to be sold with a V10 engine.</p>
